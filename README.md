Afterwards, upload the zip file to Jupyter hub or the place you have files from this repository cloned https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-language and keep the zipfile in the main folder (that is, inside cds-language but not in any other folders - unless you change the path to the data in my script). When this is done, unzip the file and run the script.
